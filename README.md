# Tink

## Overview

Personal project to create something useful/helpful/fun for the home brewing hobby.

## Ideas

'Home' section - loads some sort of informational news articles relevant to home brewing?

'Calculators' - commonly needed calculators when home brewing

'Brewers Log' - An interface and system that lets you log your home brewing processes. The idea here is to collect information about your brews and/or distilling runs so you can analyze the data with tools in the program later on.

'Trusted Info' - Maybe a section that has tried and tested, trusted brewing information that is searchable and categorized.

## Current aims

- Vector image support (use SVG files in wxWidgets)
