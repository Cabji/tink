# Tink

## Overview

Personal project to create something useful/helpful/fun for the home brewing hobby.

## Ideas

'Home' section - loads some sort of informational news articles relevant to home brewing?

'Calculators' - commonly needed calculators when home brewing

'Brewers Log' - An interface and system that lets you log your home brewing processes. The idea here is to collect information about your brews and/or distilling runs so you can analyze the data with tools in the program later on.

'Trusted Info' - Maybe a section that has tried and tested, trusted brewing information that is searchable and categorized.

## Current aims

- Calculators:
- ABV Combination: mix fluid A with fluid B to create fluid C
- Sugar content: calculate how much sugar is in a recipe if using various sugar based products such as molasses, golden syrup, agave nectar etc.
- Brewer's Log:
- What processes are there that may require logging?
- What data needs to be logged for each process?
- How much granularity is needed in that data?
