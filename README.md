# Tink

## Overview

Personal project to create something useful/helpful/fun for the home brewing hobby. 
This project is also to learn more in developing software in C++. I want to use a database to store and retrieve data, and use a program settings save/load library. Which ones exactly are not decided yet.

## Ideas

'Home' section - loads some sort of informational news articles relevant to home brewing?

'Calculators' - commonly needed calculators when home brewing

'Brewers Log' - An interface and system that lets you log your home brewing processes. The idea here is to collect information about your brews and/or distilling runs so you can analyze the data with tools in the program later on.

'Recipes' - A component to store/share recipes.

'Trusted Info' - Maybe a section that has tried and tested, trusted brewing information that is searchable and categorized.

## Current aims

- Calculators:
  - Target ABV calc: we have FAVol @ FAABV, what do we add to it to get targetABV?
- Sugar content: calculate how much sugar is in a recipe if using various sugar based products such as molasses, golden syrup, agave nectar etc.
- Brewer's Log:
- What processes are there that may require logging?
- What data needs to be logged for each process?
- How much granularity is needed in that data?
